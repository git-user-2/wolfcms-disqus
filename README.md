### How to use this plugin

After enabling the plugin, navigate to the plugin's settings page and enter your 'disqus\_shortname' value. This is the identifier that Disqus uses for a given 'forum' as they call it. You can find this value on the [Settings &gt; General][1] Disqus admin page.

  * Open: if you want comments displayed and want people to be able to post comments.

You will need to add the following lines of code to your layout - place them where you would like the comment section to appear:
